With Web Essentials extension installed, simply add SCSS files to the project and right-click > Web Compiler > Compile file.

This will generate css and min.css files alongside the source SCSS file, as well as add a compilerconfig.json configuration file used by the Web Compiler extension moving forward.

Right-click the compilerconfig.json and select "Enable compile on build..." to automate re-compile.

Note that css files are auto-generated on SCSS file save having performed the initial compile.
